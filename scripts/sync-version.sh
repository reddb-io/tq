# Sync every version declaration in the workspace to the given version
# (reddb-style, ADR 0003). Both crates inherit [workspace.package] version;
# the tq → toon dependency requirement, the resolved Cargo.lock entries, the
# npm package @reddb-io/toon and the VERSION constant it reports at runtime,
# the VS Code extension, and the workspace root package.json are the other
# declarations, so a release ships every artefact at the same version.
#
# Wired into the root package.json `version` lifecycle hook: `pnpm version
# patch` bumps the root manifest, this script fans the new version out to the
# rest, and the hook stages them into pnpm's version commit.
