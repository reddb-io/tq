/**
 * VERSION is a source constant, not a runtime read of package.json: the
 * package ships as plain ESM that may be bundled or vendored away from its
 * manifest, so reading the manifest at runtime is unreliable. That makes the
 * constant a lockstep declaration (ADR 0003) — scripts/sync-version.sh writes
 * it, and this test is what keeps it honest against the manifest.
