# TOON proposals

**tl;dr.** This directory is the design history of the reddb-io TOON dialect,
organized like the [TC39 process](https://tc39.es/process-document/): each
extension or robustness feature is a *proposal* that advances through numbered
stages until it graduates into the normative spec. Every graduated proposal
links to its section in [`toon-reddb-spec.md`](../toon-reddb-spec.md), and that
section links back here, so you can always trace a wire feature to the
motivation, measurements, and decisions that produced it.

The normative behavior lives in the specs — [official companion](../toon-official-spec.md),
[reddb flavor](../toon-reddb-spec.md), [TOONL streaming](../toonl-reddb-spec.md).
These proposals are the *why* and the *how we got here*; the spec is the *what*.

## Stages

Mapped onto the TC39 process:

| Stage | Name | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| **0** | Idea | An informal sketch — a problem worth solving, no committed design. |
| **1** | Measured proposal | A concrete design with a prototype and first token/byte measurements. |
| **2** | Frozen grammar | The wire grammar is locked; implementation slices may begin. JS and Rust never design independently. |
| **3** | Implemented opt-in | Shipped behind an encoder opt-in flag; decoding is always-on and fail-closed. |
| **4** | Graduated | Documented as normative in [`toon-reddb-spec.md`](../toon-reddb-spec.md); covered by the shared conformance corpus. |

## Adding a proposal

1. Copy [`template.md`](template.md) to `docs/proposals/<kebab-case-name>.md`.
2. Fill every section — motivation, design/grammar, how to test, measured
   numbers, why it is a good decision, stage transitions, links.
3. Add a row to the table above at the stage it currently sits.
4. When it graduates, add a normative section to
   [`toon-reddb-spec.md`](../toon-reddb-spec.md), a `> **Proposal history:**`
   backlink in that section, and flip the stage here to **4**.
